Among the plethora of mathematicians who attempted to prove Euclid's Fifth Postulate were Gauss, JÃ¡nos Bolyai, and Nikolai Lobachevsky. Each worked independently from the others, but all came to the same conclusions:

Euclid's fifth postulate was independent of the other four, and that consistent geometries could be created from its negation.

Lobachevsky famously created Hyperbolic geometry, in which the fifth postulate was replaced with:

>For any given line $R$ and a point $P$ not on $R$, in the plane containing both line $R$ and point $P$ there are at least two distinct lines through $P$ that do not intersect $R$.

This is the **only** axiomatic difference between standard Euclidean geometry and Hyperbolic geometry. As such, the first 28 propositions of Euclid's Elements are valid in Euclidean and Hyperbolic (since Euclid refrains from utilizing the parallel postulate as much as possible).

The absence of Euclid's parallel postulate causes many "weird" things to happen.

Using Geometry Explorer, you can see that rectangles do not exist in Hyperbolic geometry, the sum of angles in a triangle add up to strictly *less* than $180$ degrees, and because any quadrilateral can be cut into two triangles, that makes all quadrilaterals add up to strictly *less* than $360$ degrees.

Euclid's construction of an equilateral triangle also holds in Hyperbolic geometry just as well as it holds in Euclidean, since circles in Hyperbolic geometry are no different from standard Euclidean ones.

For any hyperbolic line, there exists one and only one perpendicular line to the given line that goes through some point. This is true because it can be proved in Absolute geometry.

Curiously, in hyperbolic geometry, the area of triangles are actually bounded. There's something like a universal speed limit, but for the areas of triangles. We can allow them to grow arbitrarily large, but their areas remain bounded by some constant.
